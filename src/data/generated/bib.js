        "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a statistical framework that generates prediction sets containing ground-truth labels with a desired coverage guarantee. The predicted probabilities produced by machine learning models are generally miscalibrated, leading to large prediction sets in conformal prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm named Sorted Adaptive Prediction Sets (SAPS), which discards all the probability values except for the maximum softmax probability. The key idea behind SAPS is to minimize the dependence of the non-conformity score on the probability values while retaining the uncertainty information. In this manner, SAPS can produce compact prediction sets and communicate instance-wise uncertainty. Extensive experiments validate that SAPS not only lessens the prediction sets but also broadly enhances the conditional coverage rate of prediction sets.",

        "abstract": "We develop a new approach to multi-label conformal prediction in which we aim to output a precise set of promising prediction candidates with a bounded number of incorrect answers. Standard conformal prediction provides the ability to adapt to model uncertainty by constructing a calibrated candidate set in place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. In order to obey this coverage property, however, conformal sets can become inundated with noisy candidates\u2014which can render them unhelpful in practice. This is particularly relevant to practical applications where there is a limited budget, and the cost (monetary or otherwise) associated with false positives is non-negligible. We propose to trade coverage for a notion of precision by enforcing that the presence of incorrect candidates in the predicted conformal sets (i.e., the total number of false positives) is bounded according to a user-specified tolerance. Subject to this constraint, our algorithm then optimizes for a generalized notion of set coverage (i.e., the true positive rate) that allows for any number of true answers for a given query (including zero). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of classification tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Multi-label classification is a common challenge in various machine learning applications, where a single data instance can be associated with multiple classes simultaneously. The current paper proposes a novel tree-based method for multi-label classification using conformal prediction and multiple hypothesis testing. The proposed method employs hierarchical clustering with labelsets to develop a hierarchical tree, which is then formulated as a multiple-testing problem with a hierarchical structure. The split-conformal prediction method is used to obtain marginal conformal $p$-values for each tested hypothesis, and two hierarchical testing procedures are developed based on marginal conformal $p$-values, including a hierarchical Bonferroni procedure and its modification for controlling the family-wise error rate. The prediction sets are thus formed based on the testing outcomes of these two procedures. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage for the prediction sets through proven family-wise error rate control of those two procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a simulation study and two real data analysis compared to other conformal methods for multi-label classification.",
